# PowerMod_HTML

 A Python based builder for an HTML based PowerMod

 It is created with the help and guidance of PhD student Yfat Ben Refael and [Dr. Michal Hochhauser](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/itr/) at [Ariel University](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/en/) in Israel.
 PowerMod is a tool for assisting Occupational Therapists who are treating people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD).
 The `PowerMod_builder.py` python script is intended to build a standalone webapp for a ["Gamified"](https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2024.2381928) intervention AKA "PowerMod".
 The product of the script is a folder, containing an `.html` file (`PowerMod.html`) and all the files and folders needed for PowerMod to work.
 In order to perform the intervention, the content of the folder should be placed on any computer. Double clicking `PowerMod.html` will open a web browser and will allow you to perform the intervention.
